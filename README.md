# one-line-palindrome-finder
Finds the longest palindromic substring of the given command line input argument and returns it, all in one line of python.

This solution implements a DP algorithm and runs in O(n^2) time and space.

# Usage
For the real one-line solution that parses arguments from command line, run
  `python3 cli-palindrome.py [arg]`
where `[arg]` is the string you'd like to find palindromes in.

To understand how it works, run the `palindrome_one_line_expanded.py` script with your argument followed by the `-v` flag. This will print an output like this:
