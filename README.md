For the real one-line solution that parses arguments from command line, run
  `python3 cli-palindrome.py [arg]`
With `[arg]` being the string you'd like to find palindromes in.

To understand how it works, run the `palindrome_one_line_expanded.py` script with your argument followed by the `-v` flag. This will print an output like this:
